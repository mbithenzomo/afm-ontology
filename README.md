## About
The Atrial Fibrillation Monitoring Ontology (AFM-Ontology) is a component of a semantic architecture for continuous health monitoring using heterogeneous health data. It is designed to formally
represent three categories of data (sensor data, expert medical knowledge, and personal information) in order to perform situation analysis and decision support for atrial fibrillation monitoring.
